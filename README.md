# Mindful Metrics

A simple web application to test and track your reflexes and typing speed. This project is built with Vite, React, TypeScript, and shadcn/ui.

## Project Vision

Mindful Metrics aims to provide an intuitive and engaging platform for users to enhance their cognitive performance through interactive tests and detailed progress tracking. Our goal is to empower users to understand and improve their reaction times, typing speed, and overall mental agility.

## Features

- **Reflex Test**: Test your reaction time. The application will calculate the average of 5 tests.
- **Typing Test**: Test your typing speed. You can choose between different modes:
  - **Time**: Test for a specific duration (15s, 30s, 60s, 120s).
  - **Words**: Type a specific number of words (10, 25, 50, 100).
- **Performance Tracking**: A dedicated page to view your history, statistics, and progress for both the reflex and typing tests.
- **Language Selection**: The typing test supports both English and French.
- **Color Sensitivity Test**: Test your ability to differentiate subtle color nuances with various difficulty levels.
- **Light/Dark Mode**: The application supports both light and dark themes.
- **Data Export**: You can save your entire performance history as a JSON file.
